## Data 
We used the Movie Dataset from Kaggle and more precisely the movie_metadata.csv and credits.csv. You can either download the whole dataset as described in the Milestone 1 part or find the only two files we used [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ekyfizxu2XMaapxhvsfxsvlNepxN_nwd?usp=sharing) (google drive).

## 1. Milestone 1

You can find our Milestone 1 description [here](DatArtists_Milestone1.pdf).

### Exploration notebook

You will find in the exploration notebook basic pre-processing and a few statistics about the dataset. To run the cells, you need to download [the Movies Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) and put the csv files into the data/ folder.

## 2. Milestone 2

You can find our Milestone 2 description [here](DatArtists_Milestone2.pdf).

### Skeleton website

The skeleton website is available [here](https://com-480-data-visualization.github.io/datavis-project-2022-datartists/).
The html, css and js can be found in the `docs/` folder.

### Treemap demo

The `treemap-preproc` notebook in the `treemap/` folder produces a `data.json` file. When running a local webserver, the `treemap.html` file shows only the treemap. The actor name can be changed in `treemap.js`. The local webserver has to be run from the root.

### Connection graph

The preprocessing and our first d3js version of the actors connection graph can be found in the `actor_network/` folder.


## 3. Milestone 3

You can find our Process book [here](ProcessBook.pdf).

The screencast is available [here](screencast-actorsgalaxy.mp4).

The source code of the webiste including html, js and css can be found in the `docs/` folder.


The `notebooks/` folder contains jupyter notebooks used for data pre-processing, `treemap/`, `actor-network/` and `scraping/` correspond respectively to the treemap, actor network and web scraper development parts.
